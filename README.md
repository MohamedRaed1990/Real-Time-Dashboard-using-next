# Real-Time Assets Dashboard

Minimal Next.js app demonstrating a client-side, real-time mock portfolio dashboard with filtering, sorting, and debounced search.

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- All data is mocked and updated client-side every 2 seconds.
- Filtering, sorting and search are client-side; search is debounced (300ms).
